This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You are comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussion and also work well in small groups with your peers. However, you do not often participate in class and are frequently unprepared. Please meet with me and we can go over some strategies to improve upon this.

You answered every single question on the problem set correctly and it is obvious that you are challenging yourself in order to understand the concepts. You do a good job aplying your knowledge and thinking skills to solve the problems.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned a A- for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.
