This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You faithfully complete the nightly homework and are fully engaged in class discussion. However, you have a bit more difficulty on in-class exams, receiving a low grade on each most tests and our cumulative final exam. I would encourage you to come see me for a bit of extra practice before in-class exams. I can help you to figure out which problems you have and which problems you need to practice more. We should practice improving your performance on these so that you can do well on the AP examination in May.

You have turned in most of your problem sets and have showed developing understanding of the concepts covered in class. You have a tendency of rushing through the tests and make some simple mistakes. You should take more time to review and check your answers. I would also like to see you continue to work on understanding the equations and their proofs.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned a C+ for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.
