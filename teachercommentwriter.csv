Bob Gentry,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,A,work ethic,participation,You have turned in all of our problem sets and have shown me your understanding of the concepts covered in class. Almost all of your answers were correct and you used equations learned in class in order to solve them. I would like to see you continue on your current trajectory next semester.
Mitch Marcus,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,B-,questions,test taking - simple mistakes,You have turned in most of your problem sets and have showed solid understanding of the concepts covered in class. You have a tendency of rushing through the tests and make some simple mistakes. You should take more time to review and check your answers.
Alex Smith,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,C,participation,tardy,You have turned in most of your problem sets and have showed a developing understanding of the concepts covered in class. I would like to see you continue to work on understanding the equations and their proofs.
Josiah Brown,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,C+,completion,test taking - simple mistakes,You have turned in most of your problem sets and have showed developing understanding of the concepts covered in class. You have a tendency of rushing through the tests and make some simple mistakes. You should take more time to review and check your answers. I would also like to see you continue to work on understanding the equations and their proofs.
Jonah Brown,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,A-,questions,participation - none,You answered every single question on the problem set correctly and it is obvious that you are challenging yourself in order to understand the concepts. You do a good job aplying your knowledge and thinking skills to solve the problems.
Dwight Howard,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,B+,test taking,homework - tardy,You completed the problem sets using equations and theorems learned in class. You always chose the easier problems and I want to see you challenging yourself in the next semester.
Kanye West,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,D,attendance,distractions,You answered some of the questions on the problem sets and I was able to see some growth from where you started at the beginning of the semester. The work you submitted was plagiarized which is unacceptable and it is apparent that you didn't challenge yourself.
Dwayne Johnson,Drugan,AP AB Calculus,F,nothing,sleeping,You did not turn in any of our problem sets and I do not have any evidence of your learning this semester. I would like to work with you either before or after class so that we can work together next semester.
