This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You have stellar work ethic and student habits. However, you do not often participate in class and are frequently unprepared. Please meet with me and we can go over some strategies to improve upon this.

You have turned in all of our problem sets and have shown me your understanding of the concepts covered in class. Almost all of your answers were correct and you used equations learned in class in order to solve them. I would like to see you continue on your current trajectory next semester.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned an A for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.
