This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You have received A’s on all tests, including a high A on your cumulative final exam. However, I would encourage you to show up on time as you tend to show up late to class and are unprepared.

You completed the problem sets using equations and theorems learned in class. You always chose the easier problems and I want to see you challenging yourself in the next semester.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned a B+ for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.
