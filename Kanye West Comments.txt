This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You always show up on time and are prepared and ready to work at the start of class. However, you are always doing something else in class and I have to ask you repeatedly to put the distraction away. A solution to this problem is to leave your backpack at my desk unless you need something from it so that there are no distractions near you.

You answered some of the questions on the problem sets and I was able to see some growth from where you started at the beginning of the semester. The work you submitted was plagiarized which is unacceptable and it is apparent that you didn't challenge yourself.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have struggled with this increased challenge. You have earned a D for the semester. It is apparent that you are struggling with this class so please come and talk with me so that we can make a plan and figure out how to improve this grade.
