This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelli’s Law. 

You have not shown any interest in class and do not make an effort to understand. Additionally, you frequently sleep in class and miss out on most topics covered, explaining your lack of understanding and sub-par performance on the tests.

You did not turn in any of our problem sets and I do not have any evidence of your learning this semester. I would like to work with you either before or after class so that we can work together next semester.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have struggled with this increased challenge. You have earned an F for the semester. If you do not improve on your in-class and homework, you will fail this class, so please put in an effort to learn and come talk to me if needed.
